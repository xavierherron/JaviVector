Javi Vector
Problem Definition

Education is important to socialization, so why not make it fun? I believe this project (Xavi Vector) can spark 
Imagination and foster a sense of nostalgia for ocean exploration for the new generation. 

Analysis

I am being tasked with creating a game using Pygame infrastructure, which generally provides the foundation 
for 2d graphics and animation through coding with Python programming. This will require at least one scene or 
backdrop that may move, and different characters or objects that interact with the scene based on user input or 
the random module’s functionality.

Design 

This program will have a main function with code to customize the application name and logs.

There will be a loop that initiates and continues game play and runs the virtual environment that will close with 
a sentinel value 

Then there will be subsequent modules for the different objects and how they will interact with the 
environment 

Abstract / Summary of my work

Xavi Vector is a young man with a peculiar interest in science, respect for nature, and a heightened instinctual 
Love for water. 

Join Xavi on his journey through the ocean frontier. God knows what you will find.

On my free time I love to read, research and share ideas via my blog, @aRealWavyTour on the x platform

Before I knew I was going to have to design a game for Python programming, I was rendering images of the 
ocean and scenes from my dreams. When I got the message about the final project, I thought of a few ideas
that I could elaborate on, but I thought Xavi vector was perfect for the ocean: art & discovery motif with my domain @aRealWavyTour
